// DOM - Document Object Model
// DOM- Connection between HTML Documents and javaScript code
// Structured Representation of HTML Documents. Allows JS to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.

// Tree structure generated by browser on HTML load

// Rule: Whatever is there in HTML document has to be in DOM

// DOM Methods & properties for DOM Manipulation . Eg: document.querySelector()

// JS is just a dialect of EcmaScript & so all DOM related stuff is not part of JS

// Methods are a part of web APIS
// Web APIs are like libraries that browsers implement & that can be access by JS code
// web APIs are, basically, libraries that are also written in JavaScript and that are automatically available for us to use.
