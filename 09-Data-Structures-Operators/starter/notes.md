Destructuring is to break a complex data structure down into a smaller data structure like a variable. So for arrays we use destructuring to retrieve elements from the array and store them into variables in a very easy way.

spread operator is a method for getting array elements

spread operator is to unpack the array
rest operator is to pack the array

the rest syntax collects all the array after the last variable.

rest means compress and spread means expand

the spread operator is used where we would otherwise write values, separated by a comma.

the rest pattern can be used where we would write variable names, separated by commas and not values separated by commas.

AND operator short circuits,

when the first value is falsy. if not then further analyse and return last truthy value

that's exactly the opposite of what happens with the OR operator, which short circuits when the first operator is true.

a set is basically just a collection of unique values.

set kind of looks similar to an array, right. So there are no key value pairs, it's just a bunch of values grouped together, in this case into a set. And just like arrays, sets are also iterables. Okay. Now, of course a set is still very different from an array.

first, because its elements are unique. And second, because the order of elements in the set is irrelevant.

a map is a data structure that we can use to map values to keys. So, just like an object data is stored in key value pairs in maps. Now, the big difference between objects and maps is that in maps, the keys can have any type and this can be huge. So, in objects, the keys are basically always strings. But in maps, we can have any type of key. It could even be objects, or arrays, or other maps.

js by itself converts string literals to string objects when particular operation is there
